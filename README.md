Aerial Firefighting Game

This game was originally created for CS 4482: Game Engine Development, taught by Kailey Joanette at The University of Western Ontario.

Web Demo: http://evanfinnigan.github.io/aerial-firefighting/

The web build of this game will run fairly slow. I recommend opening the project in Unity and building for your preferred platform. In the future I may upload builds for Windows, OS X, and Linux, and place the download links here.
